# Project Aim: 

The primary aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the estimated time and date for the final closure of an opened incident ticket within an IT service management process. This predictive model will train on historical incident management data, particularly focusing on attributes correlated with ticket closure times, to assist IT teams in effectively managing their workflows, improving response times, and enhancing overall service delivery.
